# Twitter personality insights using IBM Watson

This project feches all of the posts from a specified Twitter user and uses IBM's Watson API to predict their personality traits. Personality traits are determined by their tone, writing style, and various other factors.

**Note** that this is not 100% accurate. Users with a low number of posts may not get accurate results.

This project is written entirely in Javascript and uses the node.js & express.js frameworks. It took around 14 hours to make. I currently have no active server running this, but if you can run this yourself if you have a Twitter and Watson API key.

I made this application during the University of Houston CodeRed hackathon on November 20, 2015.

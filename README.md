# Twitter personality insights using Watson
I made this project during the CodeRed hackathon in 2015. This project fetches thousands of posts from a specified Twitter user and utilizies IBM's Watson Personality Insights technology to predict their personality. Users with low number of posts may not get accurate results.

This project is written entirely in Javascript and node.js. It took around 14 hours to complete. I currently have no active server running this, but if you can run this yourself if you have a Twitter and Watson API key.

# How to set up:

 1. Go to app.js and insert your Twitter API and Watson API credentials in the specified fields.
 2. Start the application using `node app.js`

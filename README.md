# Twitter personality insights using Watson
I made this project during the CodeRed hackathon in 2015. This project fetches thousands of posts from a specified Twitter user and utilizies IBM's Watson Personality Insights technology to predict their personality. Users with low number of posts may not get accurate results.

This project is written entirely in Javascript and node.js. It took around 14 hours to complete.

# Twitter personality insights using IBM Watson

I made this project during the University of Houston CodeRed hackathon on Friday, November 20, 2015. This project fetches all of the posts from a specified Twitter user and utilizes IBM's Watson Personality Insights technology to predict their personality traits. Personality traits are determined by their tone, writing style, and various other factors.

**Note** that this is not 100% accurate. Users with a low number of posts may not get accurate results.

This project is written entirely in Javascript and node.js. It took around 14 hours to complete. I currently have no active server running this, but if you can run this yourself if you have a Twitter and Watson API key.

# How to set up:

 1. Make sure that node.js is installed on your operating system
 2. Go to app.js and insert your Twitter API and Watson API credentials in the specified fields.
 2. Open the command line and start the application using `node app.js`

Edit: Thank you IBM for using my Twitter idea as a front page demo on the Watson personality insights page.

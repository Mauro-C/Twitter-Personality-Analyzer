# Twitter personality insights using Watson
I made this project during the CodeRed hackathon in 2015. This project fetches thousands of posts from a specified Twitter user and utilizies IBM's Watson Personality Insights technology to predict their personality.

This project is written entirely in Javascript and node.js.
